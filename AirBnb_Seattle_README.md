Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

Project Motivation

For this project, I was interestested in using AirbnB Seattle data of 2016.

How the number of host listings vary  with  months and host response time?

How the number of listings vary with the host response rate?

What are the factors playing role in delaying the respone by the host?


File Descriptions

I have uploaded the one Jupyter file of code. 

Results

The main findings of the code can be found at the link https://medium.com/@sbhatta9/an-effort-to-estimate-the-host-response-time-of-airbnb-of-washington-seattle-1f0ee2e8c39c

Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements

Must give credit to AirBnb for the data. The data is available in the kaggle.
